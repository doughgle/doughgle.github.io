Docker Inc decided not to enforce the [Docker Hub rate limit changes previously scheduled for April 1, 2025](https://www.docker.com/blog/revisiting-docker-hub-policies-prioritizing-developer-experience/).

But that update was hard to find and misinformation remains in AI responses, search results and registry vendor blogs.

So rate limits remain unchanged at:

|Account Type|Limit|
|---|---|
|anonymous users| 100 pulls per 6 hours per IP address.|
|authenticated users| 200 pulls per 6 hour period.|
|Users with a paid Docker subscription| 5000 pulls per day.|

But Docker Inc's backtrack is a pertinent reminder of how much today's dynamic CI and runtime environments may depend on Docker Hub.

I wrote a (slightly contrived) story to illustrate the impact of Docker Hub rate limits on a Kubernetes cluster.
(Link to full explainer article in the comments).

You can apply the learnings to:

- üõë reduce the risk of Denial of Service due to rate limits
- ‚è≥ reduce container startup time, and in turn, pod readiness
- üí∞ reduce egress and storage costs

In the story, 36 Kube Workers pull 3 new public images from Dockerhub.
Pretty soon, we're seeing `ErrImagePulls`.

The SREs call it "Degraded".
SecOps call it "Denial of Service".
The Users call it "Down"!

On a fresh Worker, the image doesn't exist.
Workers don't share images with each other by default.

Because of that, the Container Runtime on the Worker must pull the Image from a Registry.

Because of that, we got a 429 Too Many Requests response from DockerHub!

Full explainer article is [here](https://www.douglashellinger.com/explainer/container-oci-registry/pull-a-public-container-image/). First is an explainer on how OCI image pulls work.
If you wanna jump to the rate limit story, start from "More Clusters, More Image Pulls".
