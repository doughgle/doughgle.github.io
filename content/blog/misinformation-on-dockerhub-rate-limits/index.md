In April 2025, Docker Inc withdrew plans to further constrain [Docker Hub Rate Limits](https://www.docker.com/blog/revisiting-docker-hub-policies-prioritizing-developer-experience/).

So rate limits remain unchanged at:

|Account Type|Limit|
|---|--:|
|anonymous users| 100 pulls per 6 hours per IP address|
|authenticated users| 200 pulls per 6 hour period|
|Users with a paid Docker subscription| Unlimited pulls (up from 5000 pulls per day)|

But misinformation remains in AI responses, search results and registry vendor blogs.

Docker Inc's backtrack suggests strong feedback from customers and community. Seems many container runtime environments still depend on Docker Hub.

I wrote a story to illustrate the impact of Docker Hub rate limits on a Kubernetes cluster. (Link to full explainer article in the comments).

You can apply the learnings to:

- üõë reduce the risk of Denial of Service due to rate limits

- ‚è≥ reduce container startup time, and in turn, pod readiness

- üí∞ reduce egress and storage costs

In the story, 36 Kube Workers pull 3 new public images from Dockerhub.

Pretty soon, we're seeing `ErrImagePulls`.

The SREs call it "Degraded". SecOps call it "Denial of Service". The Users call it "Down"!

On a fresh Worker, the image doesn't exist. Workers don't share images with each other by default.

Because of that, the Container Runtime on the Worker must pull the Image from a Registry.

Because of that, we got a 429 Too Many Requests response from DockerHub!

The full explainer article is [here](https://www.douglashellinger.com/explainer/container-oci-registry/pull-a-public-container-image/). First is an explainer on how OCI image pulls work.
If you wanna jump to the rate limit story, start from "More Clusters, More Image Pulls".
