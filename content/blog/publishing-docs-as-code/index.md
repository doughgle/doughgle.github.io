Concluding a delve into docs as code...

If you wanna publish chosen articles to Medium without the tedium, [Part 3](../../how-to/publish-markdown-document-to-medium/), this how-to guide can help you.

Less time checking off the pre-publish checklist, more time for the fun parts... like generating AI art!

The guide walks you through a Github Deploy Workflow that allows you to publish your markdown content to Medium as a new draft story in just a few simple steps.

All you need is a free Github account, a free Medium account, and your markdown content stored in a git repository.

Or, if you wanna evolve your own personalised Grammarly, [Part 1](../../how-to/create-a-docs-as-code-build-pipeline) will show you how to check your markdown for spelling, style, and broken links using a docs as code build pipeline.

[Part 2](../../explainer/docs-as-code-build-pipeline-explained/) explains the tools, techniques and trade offs of a docs as code build/CI pipeline.
