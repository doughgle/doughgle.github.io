Whenever opportunity arises, I like to introduce highlights from retro computer history to my kids.

My daughter and I are big fans of the Monkey Island games from the nineties. So together, we're learning how to make an adventure game. We're learning by recreating one scene from the 1991 classic, Monkey Island 2.

Some puzzles in MI2 were particularly hard if you didn't get the language.

For example, at some point you need a spanner to close the pump valve on this hilltop (see video). If you've never heard of a "monkey wrench" (as I hadn't in 1992), you'd be stuck. After trying everything with everything, you may have got passed it, but you'd have long lost your puzzler wits.

Back then, I could've done with a translator from US English to British English. And I imagine my daughter's generation could do with one too. So while she's away, I've changed all the dialog into GenAIpha slang!

It may be "super cringe" for those who actually know the lingo, but I'm delighted with the results. Besides, its a new year so I get a fresh bucket of dad joke tokens! 😀
