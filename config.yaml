    subtitle: Helping you have fun and maximise impact by learning containers and kubernetes!
    mdtext: >
      I'm a professional and principled technologist, experienced in a range of computing layers.
      I started with hardware interfacing and device driver development, moving up the OSI stack to infrastructure, system administration, middleware and enterprise server apps.

      I believe in agile methods, open source, and everything as (clean) code.
